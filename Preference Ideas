Ideas and links for prefence/influence mechanism:

I've been reading a ton about machine learning lately, and
I think at the very least we can use some ideas behind how 
machine learning works to inform the design of our 
preference/influence mechanism.

Some stuff I have been reading/exploring:


These are some academic papers related to the stuff I am thinking about, however, I think what they
are doing is actually more sophisticated than what we need to do.

These sites contain raw data and APIs for accessing the data, I assume that Last.FM has something similar:

http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/field-list

This is the file-format used, at least by million song, echonest may be more accessible, 
but they require licensing.

This is a quick primer for the type of thing I am thinking about: https://class.coursera.org/ml/lecture/99

I am thinking at a very trivial level, we can have a preference array for each user,
generated off of song plays, likes, etc.

So Pref,i(Ai,Bi,Ci,Di....), where each node represents the average weighted value for a "genre type" or song tag
Like Aaron(Rock,Jazz,...)

And I bet we can already find or generate a similar weighted array for each song.
Something like: Song Array --> Informs Person Array --> Informs Mob Array --> Influences playlist choice, etc.

This is just an idea, there is probably a better way but its a brainstorm.
